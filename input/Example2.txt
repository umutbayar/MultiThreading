The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.  
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!  
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.  
Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim.  
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz.  
Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed.  
Jack quickly moved up the heavy sofa.
